#Data Engineering on AWS

##Summary:

1.Created a data pipeline in AWS Glue to extract Olympic data from GitHub and load it into Amazon S3, organizing the data into raw and transformed
buckets for efficient processing and storage.
2.Utilized Amazon EMR to perform comprehensive data transformations and processing on the Olympic dataset, ensuring clean, structured data stored
back in Amazon S3 for further analysis.
3.Configured Amazon Redshift to query and analyze the transformed data, leveraging capabilities for data integration and analysis.
